# redexprs
simple experiments with redis and rust, with a specific attention to working in cluster mode and with connection pooling.

## get started

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Once project dependencies are installed, start up the development environment (a local sharded redis cluster) with `docker compose up`

Run the example with `cargo run`
